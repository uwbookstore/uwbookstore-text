    <p>Why buy your textbooks from the University Book Store? We&rsquo;re independently operated and give back to the
      community through charitable donations and scholarships, which total over 1.1 million dollars to date. At the end
      of the semester you can sell your book back to us and that puts money back in your pocket!</p>
    <h4>Online Textbooks FAQ</h4>
    <div class="faq accordion">
      <h2> Q: I looked at my credit card account online, and it looks like I was charged twice for the same order. Why
        is this?</h2>
      <div>You cannot be charged twice for the same order on the website. What you are seeing is the "approval", which
        will usually disappear within 24 hours, and is not actually a charge.</div>
      <h2> Q: Why do I have to enter my credit card information if I am using a gift card that covers the cost of the
        order?</h2>
      <div>A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no payments are collected
        until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit card provider to make sure that
        there are sufficient funds available to cover the total amount of the order (your financial institution might
        list this fund check with a “Pending” notation). That happens even if you have entered a gift card with a
        balance that covers the entire cost of the order. When your order is shipped our system will apply the gift card
        first. If that covers the total amount of the order your credit/debit card will not be billed anything. If the
        gift card covers a portion of the order total your credit/debit card will be billed the difference. Only if the
        gift card has no balance would the entire amount of the order be billed to your credit/debit card.</div>
      <h2> Q: I ordered four books but was only charged for three. What happened to the fourth book?</h2>
      <div>The fourth book is probably on backorder. As soon as some copies arrive, you will be charged for it, and you
        will receive an e-mail notification.</div>
      <h2> Q: If I need to return a book, what can I do?</h2>
      <div class="retPolicy">&nbsp;</div>
      <h2> Q: How do I find the books I need for my classes?</h2>
      <div>You can look up your booklists by course number. First select the department; then select the course number;
        finally, select the section number (i.e. Math 100, Sec. 1). Listed under each course are the required and
        recommended books the instructor has assigned. Booklists are added to the website as soon as we receive them.
        Please note: the website does not indicate stock of an item.</div>
      <h2> Q: The booklist for my course says "Choose _ of 2." What does this mean?</h2>
      <div>This means the instructor has given you the choice of buying one of these two books. In most cases, they are
        slightly different editions, both of which the instructor has deemed acceptable for the course. Do not order
        both of them.</div>
      <h2> Q: How do I buy my books?</h2>
      <div>Select each book that you would like to purchase and select new, used, rental, or digital preferred. Then
        proceed to the checkout and follow the prompts.</div>
      <h2> Q: Can I use my Wiscard to pay online?</h2>
      <div>No. Unfortunately, we are not able to accept Wiscard online at this time. However, you may use Wiscard as a
        form of payment in the store.</div>
      <h2> Q: Do I have to have the books shipped to me or can you hold them for me at the bookstore?</h2>
      <div>You can choose to either have the books shipped to you or to pick them up at the store. This option is at the
        end of your order process. Please fill out the shipping address information even if you are not having them
        shipped.</div>
      <h2> Q: I chose to pick up at store. Where do I get my books?</h2>
      <div>You may pick up your books on the lower level, during regular <a
          href="http://text.uwbookstore.com/StoreHours.aspx">Book Store hours</a>. You must bring photo identification
        with you.</div>
      <h2> Q: I just placed my order. When will it be ready?</h2>
      <div>Order fulfillment time varies depending on availability of texts and quantity of orders. You will receive a
        shipping confirmation e-mail when the order is ready. If you chose to pick up at store, please wait two hours
        after receiving this e-mail to come in and pick up your books.</div>
      <h2> Q: How long will you hold my books at the store?</h2>
      <div>Your books will be held at least through the second week of class.</div>
      <h2> Q: I picked all used books. Why is my total on the confirmation e-mail the price of the new textbooks?</h2>
      <div>This is only a price estimate, not the price you will be charged. We try to respect your used/new preference
        as best we can, but we cannot guarantee new or used. You will be charged after we pick the books for the amount
        of used/new books we were able to get for you. This total will be indicated on your shipping confirmation
        e-mail.</div>
      <h2> Q: I did not receive one of my books and the receipt says "customer error". What does this mean?</h2>
      <div>Customer error means we found a mistake on your order. Most likely, you accidentally ordered two of the same
        book. Therefore, we cancelled one copy of the order for you.</div>
      <h2> Q: I am studying abroad. Can I have my books shipped to me overseas?</h2>
      <div>No. Unfortunately, we are not able to ship books ordered online overseas. Please call the textbook department
        if you are interested in shipping overseas.</div>
      <h2> Q: How do I cancel some or all of the books on my order?</h2>
      <div>You cannot cancel the order online. You must contact the textbook department at <span class="phone">(608)
          257-3784</span> ext.5905. </div>
