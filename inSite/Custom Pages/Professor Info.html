    We encourage you to put all book information on the Faculty Center (<a href="http://my.wisc.edu/" title="MyUW"
      target="_blank" class="external-lnk">MyUW <em class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></em></a>) by July
    1<sup>st</sup> for Fall semester, and December 1<sup>st</sup> for
    Spring semester courses. The University Book Store collects book information
    daily from the SIS site, so there is no need to contact us directly unless
    you have a question about a title. If you have questions, please contact
    <a href="mailto:adellger@uwbookstore.com">adellger@uwbookstore.com</a> or
    phone us (608-257-3784 ext. 5907).

  <h4>Text and/or Supply Adoption Guidelines</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Please use your University of Wisconsin email account for adoptions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include the phrase TEXTBOOK ADOPTION in the subject heading of your
      message. Also include you contact information in case we have questions or
      additional information.
    </li>
    <li>
      For each text item, we need the following information:
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>Semester</li>
        <li>
          Department &amp; Course Number (please include lecture/section number
          if applicable)
        </li>
        <li>Estimated Enrollment</li>
        <li>Author</li>
        <li>Title and ISBN (if available)</li>
        <li>Edition</li>
        <li>Publisher or manufacturer</li>
        <li>Is the item required or recommended?</li>
      </ul>
      <!--To put in a <strong>Supply Order or Text Order</strong> please contact -->
    </li>
    <!-- <li>It helps everyone if we receive your textboook and/or supply adoptions one to two months before the start of each semester. Books and course supplies can take a few days to arrive, or may take a few months, depending on availability from the publisher. Submitting your book list before finals week also benefits your students. If we recognize that the books are required for the upcoming semester, we can offer the students a better price on books we buy back. Finally, a one to two month lead offers us optimal opportunity to process orders, deal with shortages or acquisition problems and receive materials.</li>
        <li>Overseas ordering usually takes a minimum of 6-8 weeks, barring the usual close-down times of August and December for the European holiday seasons.</li>
        <li>We do not carry textbook adoptions over from semester to semester. Each semester requires a unique request for adoption. We will order your material whenever we receive notification of the need. </li>
        <li>Please notify us if you have any significant enrollment increases. We have no direct access to information about increased enrollment. <strong>We rely foremost on timely instructor notification.</strong> We are always glad to order additional copies of textbooks needed by your students. We offer a textbook reservation system to each student, which begins on the Friday of the first week of class. </li>
        <li>We start returning our overstock of textbooks during the tenth week of of each semester (Summer Session return dates vary according to session length). Please encourage your students to make all of their purchases before those times. </li>
        <li>If you have any questions about textbooks, editions, publishers, ISBNs or anything related to textbooks, please don't hesitate to contact our text department.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions on supplies be it computer supplies, art supplies, etc. Please contact the appropriate deparment.</li>-->
