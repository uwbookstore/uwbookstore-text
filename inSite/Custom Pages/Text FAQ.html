        A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no payments
        are collected until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit
        card provider to make sure that there are sufficient funds available to cover the total
        amount of the order (your financial institution might list this fund check with a "Pending"
        notation). That happens even if you have entered a gift card with a balance that covers the
        entire cost of the order. When your order is shipped our system will apply the gift card
        first. If that covers the total amount of the order your credit/debit card will not be
        billed anything. If the gift card covers a portion of the order total your credit/debit card
        will be billed the difference. Only if the gift card has no balance would the entire amount
        of the order be billed to your credit/debit card.

        University Book Store receives information regarding textbook requirements from your
        professors as early as months before the semester starts through the first weeks of classes.
        We make every effort to get your books on the shelf as soon as we learn of the requirements.
        If you don't find a book, you can keep checking back or you can go to the information
        counter in the course materials department to inquire on the status of your book.

        Textbooks are located on the lower level of University Book Store at 711 State Street.
        Class books are arranged first by department, next by class within each department. You
        should bring a list of your classes with you when you shop for your books each semester.
        This list should contain the names of your professors along with lecture and section
        numbers. This will help you make sure you're buying the right books for the right classes.
        It's not uncommon to have three professors teaching a particular class using three
        completely different sets of books.
