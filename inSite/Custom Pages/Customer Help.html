    <h2>Clearance Item Policy</h2>
    <p>You will not be charged for your order until the order ships. We search for clearance items at each of our 5
      locations
      so it may take longer for those items to be pulled. If you are placing a Next Day Air or 2<sup>nd</sup> Day Air
      order, the order
      processing time will be delayed while we check all our locations for the discontinued item. If we don't find the
      item,
      your order packing slip will show it as "Discontinued" and you will not receive that item.</p>

        A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no
        payments are
        collected until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit
        card provider
        to make sure that there are sufficient funds available to cover the total amount of the
        order (your
        financial institution might list this fund check with a "Pending" notation). That
        happens even if you
        have entered a gift card with a balance that covers the entire cost of the order. When
        your order is
        shipped our system will apply the gift card first. If that covers the total amount of
        the order your
        credit/debit card will not be billed anything. If the gift card covers a portion of the
        order total your
        credit/debit card will be billed the difference. Only if the gift card has no balance
        would the entire
        amount of the order be billed to your credit/debit card.

        A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no payments
        are collected until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit
        card provider to make sure that there are sufficient funds available to cover the total
        amount of the order (your financial institution might list this fund check with a "Pending"
        notation). That happens even if you have entered a gift card with a balance that covers the
        entire cost of the order. When your order is shipped our system will apply the gift card
        first. If that covers the total amount of the order your credit/debit card will not be
        billed anything. If the gift card covers a portion of the order total your credit/debit card
        will be billed the difference. Only if the gift card has no balance would the entire amount
        of the order be billed to your credit/debit card.

        The University Book Store receives information regarding textbook requirements from your

        We make every effort to get your books on the shelf as soon as we learn of the requirements.

        Class books are arranged first by department, next by class within each department. You
        should bring a list of your classes with you when you shop for your books each semester.
        This list should contain the names of your professors along with lecture and section
        numbers. This will help you make sure you're buying the right books for the right classes.
        It's not uncommon to have three professors teaching a particular class using three

        Occasionally books are unavailable when you make your first trip to the University Book
        Store. In most cases this is not because a book has sold out, but because it simply has not
        arrived. Instructors are made aware of these out of stock situations and will usually adjust
        assignments until books arrive. When enrollments are larger than expected, instructors
        notify the Book Store of the increases and books are re-ordered. These usually arrive by the
        end of the first week of classes. We do begin taking reservations for books at the end of
        the first week. Stop in at the service counter in the text department and fill out a form so
        that we can save a copy of the book for you and send you a card notifying you of its
        arrival.

        Yes. The University Book Store offers its buyback service for two basic reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>to provide students cash for books they no longer need; and,</li>
          <li>to provide a supply of used books for students to buy at substantial savings.</li>

      <div id="studentFaq7" role="region" aria-labelledby="studentFaq7id" class="Accordion-panel" hidden="hidden">
        <p>The buyback price is determined by a variety of factors. For buyback pricing, textbooks
          fall
          into one of three categories. During the course of a semester or buyback period, a title
          may
          move from one category to another based on demand. The categories are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>½ Price Books</strong><br>
            If a faculty member has notified the University Book
            Store that a book will be used on campus next semester, in most cases we will pay
            ½ of
            the current new book price, even if you bought the book used or the new book price
            was
            lower at the time of your purchase. When we have met our anticipated needs for that
            title for the upcoming semester, we will purchase that title for the used book
            wholesalers.</li>
          <li><strong>Books not ordered for the upcoming semester</strong><br>
            Used book wholesalers
            determine the prices they will pay for certain books. The University Book Store
            technically acts as the wholesaler's agent and buys the book for the company from
            the
            student, and thus we must use their prices. Nationwide demand, current wholesaler
            supply
            and anticipated revision dates are some of the factors that the wholesale companies
            use
            in determining the prices they offer.</li>
          <li><strong>Books that we are not buying back</strong><br>
            There are four reasons why a book may not have any buyback value:
            <ol>
              <li>A new edition has been published</li>
              <li>There is little or no nationwide demand</li>
              <li>There is excess wholesale supply</li>
              <li>The book is in poor (non-salable) condition</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

        Absolutely! By aggressively purchasing used books and participating in buyback, you can save
        up to 75% off the new book price. (For example, if you bought a used copy of a $50 book for
        $37.50 and then sold it back at ½ price of $25, you would pay only $12.50 for the use
        of that book; that's only 25% on the new book price.)
