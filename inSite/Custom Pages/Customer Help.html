        A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no
        payments are
        collected until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit
        card provider
        to make sure that there are sufficient funds available to cover the total amount of the
        order (your
        financial institution might list this fund check with a "Pending" notation). That
        happens even if you
        have entered a gift card with a balance that covers the entire cost of the order. When
        your order is
        shipped our system will apply the gift card first. If that covers the total amount of
        the order your
        credit/debit card will not be billed anything. If the gift card covers a portion of the
        order total your
        credit/debit card will be billed the difference. Only if the gift card has no balance

        A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no payments
        are collected until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit
        card provider to make sure that there are sufficient funds available to cover the total
        amount of the order (your financial institution might list this fund check with a "Pending"
        notation). That happens even if you have entered a gift card with a balance that covers the
        entire cost of the order. When your order is shipped our system will apply the gift card
        first. If that covers the total amount of the order your credit/debit card will not be
        billed anything. If the gift card covers a portion of the order total your credit/debit card
        will be billed the difference. Only if the gift card has no balance would the entire amount
        of the order be billed to your credit/debit card.
